# Agromind
A local host app to help farmers to suggest crops and give bunch of info
Was supposed to operate in multiple languages and use weather api to get precise info of the farmer's geographical location
Bunch of files here and there, the app was working but couldn't implement api because of key issue but multi languages was working, unfortunately the proper github that was made was kind of destroyed because someone in team replaced everything while trying to add his files and it was a mess, here is what's left.
